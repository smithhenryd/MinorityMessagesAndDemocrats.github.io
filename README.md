Henry is a rising junior at Yale College majoring in Statistics & Data Science with an interest in U.S. government, specifically political communication between elected officials and their constituencies. For his Google Summer of Code project in collaboration with Red Hen Lab, he will be working with mentors [Jungseock Joo](http://home.jsjoo.com/) at the University of California, Los Angeles and [Sumit Vohra](https://www.linkedin.com/authwall?trk=gf&trkInfo=AQF46VQT8HsnZwAAAXIUesZQlLHEC_YJjPOrZoXZPgUeXgBJYK7eTaLs0b2ATrdG6kaP8ucfy_419uoPg6UMRNVnUkIadUS_qCdwAaUu2YoCv7EldRUVNnJg9KsJtgf73FXTUKc=&originalReferer=http://www.redhenlab.org/summer-of-code/red-hen-lab-gsoc-2020-projects&sessionRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fin.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fsumit-vohra-224484a0). The project will focus on understanding how Democratic politicians communicate with racial, sexual, and gender minority voters through social media visual imagery. By the generosity of Dr. Joo and his colleagues, images will be sourced through a dataset compiled from politician Facebook accounts during the 2018 midterm election cycle. 

The complete proposal can be found in the [Henry's Github repository for the project](https://github.com/smithhenryd/GSoC_2020_MinorityMessagesAndDemocrats-/blob/master/Henry_SmithSummerResearchProposal.pdf).
